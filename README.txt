READ ME:
When the program asks for amount needed let's say you need 41,000,000
you would imput 41
and for the units input 1,000,000
Ths is temporary until I can make letters represent numbers such as k = 1000
I've listed numbers below so you can easily just copy and paste



k = 1000
K = 1000
m = 1000000
M = 1000000
b = 1000000000
B = 1000000000
t = 1000000000000
T = 1000000000000
qd = 1000000000000000
QD = 1000000000000000
qn = 1000000000000000000
QN = 1000000000000000000
sx = 1000000000000000000000
SX = 1000000000000000000000
sp = 1000000000000000000000000
SP = 1000000000000000000000000
oc = 1000000000000000000000000000
OC = 1000000000000000000000000000
